# BiasCorrectQ [BETA]
This code can be used to adjust simulated streamflow results at a monthly timestep to be consistent with monthly to annual aspects of streamflow from an observed dataset.

The methods follow those outlined in Snover et al. (2003):

NOTE: This is BETA code! It works to bias correct simulated historical to observed streamflow given data at equal timesteps (Monthly ONLY) and equal periods of record.

###TO-DO
* Extend the methods to bias correct future streamflow at equal monthly timesteps and periods of record.

###Wish List
* Extend the methods to handle different periods of record at a monthly timestep.
* Extend the methods to handle daily timesteps.
